# deni111BG's dot files
all my customized linux dotfiles (as of 11/9/2023) in one place so i can use this repo to reproduce my system

With a script that puts all the configs in their places

## Dependacies:
pacman -S zsh neofetch unzip

## Oh My Zsh Install Script:
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

### y is unzip a dependacie?
unzip is used to unpack zsh plugins cuz a folder of plugins is way too many files for me to upload to github
