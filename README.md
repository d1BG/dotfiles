# deni111BG's dot files
All my custom linux dotfiles (as of 1/18/2024) in one place
With a script that puts all the configs in their places (that i hope works)

## Dependacies:
pacman -S curl git zsh neofetch unzip btop eza kitty imagemagick

### Optional:
yay is recommended
mangohud gets configs so u might want to install it

## Download and run script:

git clone 'https://github.com/d1BG/dotfiles'

chmod u+x dotfiles/DotFiles.sh

./dotfiles/DotFiles.sh

## Oh My Zsh Install Script:
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

### y is unzip a dependacie?
unzip is used to unpack zsh plugins cuz a folder of plugins is way too many files for me to upload to github
